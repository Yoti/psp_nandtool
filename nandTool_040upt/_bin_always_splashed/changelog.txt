	- additional version that doesn't disable the splash when iaccept is present
0.4NEO (Aug 20 2008) 
	- fixed ids dump/restore messages leaving a blank line at the bottom sometimes
	- made fade in/out consistent in menu (no fade ins)

0.4 alpha 10 (Aug 12 2008)

	- adden in various full screen fades (not 100% yet)
0.4 alpha 6

	- corrected a bug in elf menu (launching nothing when no elf were present)
	- corrected a bug in elf menu that did not display "file launching" info
0.4 alpha 5 (released to hellcat)
	- fixed a bug that did not allow cancelling of usbhost connecting
	- format partitions disables scramble for FAT PSP (for custom firmware)
0.4 alpha 4 test only
	- all dialogs should be fully functional now, slim idstore should dump/write properly
0.4 ()
	- added lines and boxes (eye candy)
	- corrected a bug that would not allow proper selection of files after 23 (increased to 26 onscreen)
	- fixed a bug where overwrite was not possible when dumping
	- added progress bar
	- added support for usbhostfs
	- moved usb/usbhost prx required location to ms:/elf/prx
	- underscore is displayed as a space in ELF and nand dump selection menus
	- file extension is no longer displayed for elf or nand images
	- key dumping folder name increment is now more like nand dump increment (automatic though)
0.3 BETA (Dec 5 2007)
	- disable power switch while NAND read/write functions are being processed
	- undocumented method to attempt to ignore bad blocks when writing to NAND
	- dump/write methods redone, base directory is now ms0:/nandTool_dumps/ instead of root directory
		no longer relies on specific file names
		write menu will only show files with the correct size for the hardware
		more than the specific number of files can be utilized
		dumper adds relevant info to filename to try and make it unique
	- identifies PSP version
	- added info to main menu, displays info collected at app boot
	- MS to USB mounting via select key in the main menu
	- idstore dump to key files (slim and fat)
	- creating a file with the correct name along side the elf will auto skip the warning screen (see warning screen for the file name)
	- integrated ELF loader
	- option provided on des.cem MS installs to format all partitions
	- logical write idstore from key files to NAND
	- supports being a des.cem resurrection.elf replacement (quit is replaced by shutdown in this case)

0.2 (Nov 4 2007)
	- logical format of flash corrected to allow unused/empty blocks where needed to support lflashfmt on slim
	- raw writing now checks (and repairs) bad block marks in spare data so new bad blocks will not be flashed due to faulty dumps
	 < bugs solved in 0.2 >
	- lflash format and subsequent install of 3.71 using des.cem V3 on slim will result in trashed partitions and brick
	- rewriting a "phat" psp full image will result in 30 block with ECC data when the original dump has no ECC data
	- writing ofw or slim when bad blocks were present resulted in unbootable PSP

0.1a (Nov 1 2007)
	- corrected bugs with writing nand
	- bad blocks were not skipped properly causing slim or ofw not to work on boot
	- partial blocks written as original (solves ECC on pages which had none before, chiefly idstore index)
	- typo cause lflash only option to write idstore as well

0.1 (Oct 16 2007)
	- initial release

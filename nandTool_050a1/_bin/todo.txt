I didn't put it up on the board but I want to share the todo list... and this is a lot of work if I manage to find the time to do them all
- polish pseudo gui (add graphical reps of button images xo etc)
- safe test nand function (seek ecc errors, do a simple chkdsk to see partitions are intact and no blocks repeat)
- dangerous test nand function (use nandTest functions to do full block checks - best used on questionable PSP where hardware issues are suspected)
- get actual fw version from IPL (can tell if it is m33 or not, but not minor revision)
- mirrored writes (does not erase and overwrite blocks that already contain data that is being written)
- ini parser (auto start to elf menu, set elf menu mode, set default path, set colors, ?png background image?, logging enable, change O/X buttons function)
- R/L shoulder in elf menu (change between elf folder and psp/game/(eboot), psp/game150/(eboot), psp/game3xx/(eboot))
- ECC testing to all dump/write functions, verify data before writing to disk/nand
